# The Mountain Logbook Online

## An online tool for recording mountain walking experiences. Replicates, and improves on, a traditional paper logbook.

A 'Data Centric Development' milestone project for Code Institute.

The Mountain Logbook Online is a tool for recording mountain walking experiences. The essential user requirement is to be able to record and store details of any number of walk/hike/climbs the user has completed. In essence, a digital logbook with which an individual and keep a record of thier experience for personal interest or for the purposes of gathering evidence of experience. There is an export functionality so the the complete 'logbook' can be submitted to an awarding body for assessment.

A website using the Flask framework with MongoDB datastore.

## Demo

## UX
The application is primarily for people who will already be keeping a logbook of some kind, likely either a paper based or spreadsheet. For this reason the user interface will use a table layout as this will be familiar and aid takup.

### User Stories
1. On first opening the application the user can either create a new account by supplying a unique email address or log in to see thier previously entered records by supplying thier email address.
2. It is obvious how to add a new record without reading any documentation.
3. Existing records are clearly displayed and can be searched for in a number of ways.
4. Existing records can be amended or deleted by the user.
5. Users can see 'highest point' markers from other users on a map where other users have chosen to share this information.

## Features
- Basic user authentication by email

## Future Additions
- Directly connect to 'Mountain-Training.org' (UK governing body) website for import into thier CMS for candidate assessment.
- Add pre-dictated highest points (mountain summits) that users can select.
- Interactions with other users.
- Link a log entry with another user in the system
- Record waypoint coordinates and map these
